What this line means (VERY IMPORTANT)

Use AuthorEntity + authors table to store EXAM_USER

Why this is a warning, not an error

You are intentionally doing this:

authors table
 ├── AUTHOR
 └── EXAM_USER

This is called:

Single Table Inheritance (Role-based users)

✔ This is GOOD for:

Early stage products

MVPs

Platforms like yours
 
It becomes a problem ONLY IF:

EXAM_USER has completely different fields

Or millions of users + performance issues

for now: THIS IS 100% CORRECT
