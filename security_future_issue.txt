Perfect — this tells us **exactly** what is wrong.

Your frontend is blank because your backend is returning a **cyclic JSON structure**.

Look at your response:

```
question
  → options
      → question
          → options
              → question
                  → options
                      → question
                          → ...
```

It keeps nesting infinitely.

That’s why:

* Browser freezes
* React renders nothing
* Page becomes blank
* Network tab shows huge 108KB JSON

This is a **classic JPA bidirectional relationship infinite recursion problem**.

# 🎯 Why This Happens

You have something like:

```java
class Question {
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "question")
    List<Option> options;
}

class Option {
    @ManyToOne
    Question question;
}
```

When Jackson serializes:

Question → options → question → options → question → options → ...

Infinite loop.

---

# ✅ Correct Fix (Backend Only — No Frontend Changes Needed)

You must break the JSON recursion.

---

# ✅ OPTION 1 (Quickest Fix)

In `OptionEntity` add:

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnore;

@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "question_id")
@JsonIgnore
private QuestionEntity question;
```

That stops:

```
option → question → options → question
```

Now your JSON becomes:

```
Question
   options [
       { id, optionText, correct }
   ]
```

Clean. No recursion.

---

# ✅ OPTION 2 (Better Production Way)

Instead of returning entities directly,
use DTOs.

You already defined in frontend:

```ts
export interface Question {
  id: string;
  questionText: string;
  options: QuestionOption[];
}
```

So backend should return:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "...",
    "questionText": "...",
    "options": [
      { "id": "...", "text": "..." }
    ]
  }
]
```

NOT entire author object
NOT password
NOT nested objects
NOT difficulty
NOT category

Right now your backend is exposing:

* Author password (!!)
* Internal fields
* Entire nested object graph

That is dangerous.

# 🔥 Why Page Is Blank

React probably expects:

```ts
option.text
```

But backend is sending:

```json
optionText
```

Also:

```json
options[].question.options.question.options...
```

So your UI breaks during render.

---

# 🚀 What You Should Do RIGHT NOW

### 1️⃣ Go to `OptionEntity`

Add:

```java
@JsonIgnore
private QuestionEntity question;
```

### 2️⃣ Restart backend

### 3️⃣ Refresh page

Your page will immediately work.

---

# 🔥 Then Next Step (Important)

Create proper DTO:

```java
public record QuestionResponse(
    UUID id,
    String questionText,
    List<OptionResponse> options
) {}

public record OptionResponse(
    UUID id,
    String text
) {}
```

And map manually in service.

That will:

* Remove infinite nesting
* Remove password leak
* Reduce JSON size
* Improve performance
* Make frontend stable

---

# ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE

Your response currently includes:

```json
"password": "$2a$10$..."
```

You are exposing hashed passwords in API response.

This is a serious security flaw.

Even hashed passwords must NEVER be returned.

---

# 🎯 Summary

Blank page reason:
✔ Infinite JSON recursion
✔ Huge nested response
✔ React crashes

Frontend change needed?
❌ NO

Backend fix needed?
✔ Add @JsonIgnore on Option → Question
✔ Or use DTO (recommended)

---

If you want, send:

* QuestionEntity
* OptionEntity

I’ll give you exact clean production-ready version.
